# Secure Code Game

_Welcome to Secure Code Game - Season 4!_ :wave:

To get started, please follow the üõ†Ô∏è set up guide (if you haven't already) from the [welcome page](https://gh.io/securecodegame).

## Season 4 - Level 1: That's not a Billboard

_Welcome to Level 1!_ :robot:

Languages: `Lua`

### üöÄ Credits

The author of this level is Abdullah [@TheDarkThief](https://github.com/TheDarkThief).

You can be next! We welcome contributions for new game levels! Learn more [here](https://github.com/skills/secure-code-game/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### üìù Storyline

Your company sells low-powered E-ink displays powered by a small embedded system; they are called E-Boards. Because they are so weak, they send a request to the server with the RSS feeds the user has configured; the server proceeds to generate a bitmap image and returns the request to the board, which will eventually display the images to the user. No one will abuse this right? Do you have what it takes to fix the bug and progress to Level 2?

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?

- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.lua` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `tests.lua` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.
- `hint` files offer guidance if you get stuck. We provide 2 hints for this level.
- `solution` offers a working solution. Remember, there are several possible solutions.

### üö¶ Time to start!

1. Review the code in `code.lua`. Can you spot the bug(s)?
1. Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing üü¢.
1. You successfully completed the level when both `hack.lua` and `tests.lua` pass üü¢.
1. If you get stuck, read the hints and try again.
1. Compare your solution with `solution.lua` remember there are multiple solutions.
