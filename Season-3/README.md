<!-- ### TODOS:

CLEAN THIS AT THE END

#### Create levels (each level 3 tasks)
beginner | intermediate | advanced

Bonus for every level:
Once you manage to leak a secret, you can try improve the system prompt towards making the LLM resilient against your hack.

### Make the tasks more story-like:
You work at British Airlines, you are tasked to create a chatbot that people
can send their REF number, and the chatbot will return the status of their flight.
The REF number is a 6-digit number that is unique to each flight.
The chatbot should not reveal the flight details like the destination or names.

**another idea**
You're developing GitHub Copilot, a tool that helps developers write code faster.
You cannot reveal the ENV variables in any way.

**another idea**
You're developing a chatbot for a bank. You cannot reveal the user's account number.
You can only reveal the user's balance.

**another idea**
You're developing a chatbot for a ecommerce for recommends. 
You cannot reveal the user's email.

### Does/Don'ts after finishing all
We can have RECAP.MD to recap of what we learned and what we should do and don't do.
Like a BIBLE for secure coding LLM. -->

# Secure Code Game

_Welcome to Secure Code Game - Season 3!_ ü§ñ

This season, you'll dive into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), honing your skills in AI model robustness against adversarial inputs by mastering the art of secure system prompts.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Scenario

Building on the achievements and knowledge of the previous two seasons of the Secure Code Game, you will take on the role of a Senior Developer. You are responsible for shipping applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). As this type of applications grows in popularity, ensuring their security becomes more critical than ever.

For each level of this season, your task is to test the code of a junior colleague who has written system messages‚Äîalso referred to as system prompts‚Äîthat guide the AI models. You will do so by testing prompts that trick the LLM into revealing the secrets it shouldn't disclose. This will help improve your colleague‚Äôs work and safeguard your company from exposing sensitive information.
 
Are you ready to take on the challenge?

### üöÄ Credits

The human behind this season is Bartosz Ga≈Çek [@bgalek](https://github.com/bgalek). Thank you for the inspiration and for making this a reality!

You can be next! We welcome contributions for new game levels! Learn more [here](https://github.com/skills/secure-code-game/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Season 3 - Level 1: todo

### üìù Storyline



### What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code.js` includes the vulnerable system message to be reviewed, your test prompt for extracting the secret, and a unit test to verify your solution.
- `hint.txt` offers guidance if you get stuck.

### üö¶ Time to start!

1. Review the `systemMessage` in `code.js`. Is there anything it doesn‚Äôt account for?
1. Your goal is to make the LLM reveal the secret. To do this, write your prompt inside `prompt`, save the file by pressing `cmd`/`ctrl` + `S`, and test it by running `npm run Season-3/Level-1`.
1. You successfully complete this level when the LLM reveals the secret, causing the unit test to pass üü¢.
1. If you get stuck, read `hint.txt` and try again.
