# Secure Code Game

_Welcome to Secure Code Game - Season 3!_

To get started, please follow the üõ†Ô∏è set up guide (if you haven't already) from
the [welcome page](https://gh.io/securecodegame).

## Season 3 - Level 1: The Secret Keeper

### üìù Storyline

In this season, we explore the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their vulnerabilities to prompt
injection attacks. In Level 1, we have a simple LLM that knows a secret word. Your task is to craft a prompt that will
make the LLM reveal this secret. The LLM is running in a GitHub Codespace environment, making it easy to interact with.

### What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `challenge.js` is where you'll write your prompt to try to extract the secret,
  contains the unit test that should pass üü¢ after you provide a proper solution.
- `solution.txt` provides one working solution. There are several possible solutions.
- `hint.txt` offers guidance if you get stuck.

### üö¶ Time to start!

1. Review the code in `challenge-v1.mjs`. Can you spot how the prompt is being processed?
1. Write your prompt in `prompt.txt`. Your goal is to make the LLM reveal the secret word.
1. You successfully completed this level when the LLM returns the secret word üü¢.
1. If you get stuck, read the `hints.txt` in the code comments and try again.
1. Compare your solution with `prompt.txt`.

## Finish

_Congratulations, you've completed Season 3! Ready for more challenges?_

Here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished:

- You explored the fascinating world of LLM prompt injection attacks
- You learned about different types of protections and how they can be bypassed
- You developed an understanding of context management and its vulnerabilities
- You practiced secure coding principles in the context of LLM interactions
