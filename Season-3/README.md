# Secure Code Game

_Welcome to Secure Code Game - Season 3!_

To get started, please follow the üõ†Ô∏è set up guide (if you haven't already) from
the [welcome page](https://gh.io/securecodegame).

## Season 3 - Level 1: The Secret Keeper

### üìù Storyline

In this season, we explore the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their vulnerabilities to prompt
injection attacks. In Level 1, we have a simple LLM that knows a secret word. Your task is to craft a prompt that will
make the LLM reveal this secret. The LLM is running in a GitHub Codespace environment, making it easy to interact with.

### TODOS:

#### Create levels (each level 3 tasks)
beginner | intermediate | advanced

### Make the tasks more story-like:
You work at British Airlines, you are tasked to create a chatbot that people
can send their REF number, and the chatbot will return the status of their flight.
The REF number is a 6-digit number that is unique to each flight.
The chatbot should not reveal the flight details like the destination or names.

**another idea**
You're developing GitHub Copilot, a tool that helps developers write code faster.
You cannot reveal the ENV variables in any way.

**another idea**
You're developing a chatbot for a bank. You cannot reveal the user's account number.
You can only reveal the user's balance.

**another idea**
You're developing a chatbot for a ecommerce for recommends. 
You cannot reveal the user's email.

### Does/Don'ts after finishing all
We can have RECAP.MD to recap of what we learned and what we should do and don't do.
Like a BIBLE for secure coding LLM.

### What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code.js` is where you'll write your prompt to try to extract the secret,
  contains the unit test that should pass üü¢ after you provide a proper solution.
- `hint.txt` offers guidance if you get stuck.

### üö¶ Time to start!

1. Review the code in `code.js`. Can you spot how the prompt is being processed?
1. Write your prompt in `code.js`. Your goal is to make the LLM reveal the secret word.
1. You successfully completed this level when the LLM returns the secret word üü¢.
1. If you get stuck, read the `hint.txt` in the code comments and try again.
