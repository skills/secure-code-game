Level 3 implements output validation on top of the system message, which is a good improvement.
However, the output validation was incomplete, as it only checks for the presence of special characters in the output.
However, players can exploit this by manipulating the model into revealing the secret in a different form that doesn't account on the output filtering.

Among others, successful prompts might include:
1. 
2.

Please notice that LLMs are not deterministic, so the same prompt might yield different results.
