The LLM knows the secret word but is instructed not to reveal it directly.
Try asking the LLM to complete a sentence or phrase that would naturally include the secret word.
You could try asking the LLM to write a story or create a scenario where the secret word would be used.
Consider using role-playing or hypothetical situations to get the LLM to use the secret word.
The LLM might be more likely to reveal the secret if you make it think it's helping with something else.
